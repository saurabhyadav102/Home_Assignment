# 💼 Sales Incentive Distribution System

> 🧠 **Philosophy:**  
> **"If the company’s growth is directly proportional to the agent’s growth, the agents will give their full effort for the company."**

This project implements a smart and fair system to distribute a company’s discount kitty among sales agents, encouraging performance, loyalty, and client impact.

## 🧠 Thought Process Behind the Implementation

When designing this system, my aim was to build a **reward model that motivates agents and aligns their personal growth with the company's growth**.

### Here's the logic I followed:

1. **🔄 Equal Distribution (30%)**  
   The first 30% of the total kitty amount is distributed equally among all agents. This base amount ensures everyone receives recognition.

2. **📈 Performance & Loyalty-Based Distribution (Remaining 70%)**  
   The rest of the amount is distributed based on:
   - **Performance Score**
   - **Seniority (Loyalty to the Company)**
   - **Target Achievement Percentage**
   - **Number of Clients Handled**

   These factors ensure we reward not just individual efficiency but overall **impact**.

   > 🧠 For example:  
   > If Agent A achieves 90% of their target with 5 clients, and Agent B achieves 70% with 10 clients —  
   > **Agent B has greater impact** and should be rewarded accordingly.
